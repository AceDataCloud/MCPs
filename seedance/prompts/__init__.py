    """Guide for choosing the right Seedance tool for video generation."""
    return """# Seedance Video Generation Guide

When the user wants to generate video, choose the appropriate tool based on their needs:

## Text to Video (Simple)
**Tool:** `seedance_generate_video`
**Use when:**
- User gives a text description: "make me a video of a cat"
- User wants Seedance to handle the visuals from scratch
- Quick, prompt-based video creation

**Example:** "Create a video of astronauts in space"
-> Call `seedance_generate_video` with prompt="Astronauts floating in space, stars in background, cinematic lighting"

## Image to Video (Reference Images)
**Tool:** `seedance_generate_video_from_image`
**Use when:**
- User provides an image URL to animate
- User wants video to start/end with a specific image
- User wants style guidance from reference images
- User needs precise visual control

**Example:** "Animate this image: [image_url]"
-> Call `seedance_generate_video_from_image` with first_frame_url=image_url and appropriate prompt

## Choosing the Right Model
- **Best quality + audio:** `doubao-seedance-1-5-pro-251215`
- **Balanced (default):** `doubao-seedance-1-0-pro-250528`
- **Fastest/cheapest:** `doubao-seedance-1-0-pro-fast-251015`
- **Lightweight T2V:** `doubao-seedance-1-0-lite-t2v-250428`
- **Lightweight I2V:** `doubao-seedance-1-0-lite-i2v-250428`

## Checking Status
**Tool:** `seedance_get_task`
**Use when:**
- Generation takes time and user wants to check if it's ready
- User asks "is my video done?"

## Important Notes:
1. Video generation is async in MCP and should return quickly with a task_id
2. After submission, poll with `seedance_get_task` until the final video URLs are available
2. Default resolution is 720p, default ratio is 16:9
3. Duration range: 2-12 seconds
4. Only 1.5 Pro model supports audio generation
5. Use 'flex' service_tier for 50% cost savings
6. Use seed parameter for reproducible results
7. reference_image_urls CANNOT be combined with first_frame/last_frame
8. Use callback_url for async processing in production

def seedance_workflow_examples() -> str:
    """Common workflow examples for Seedance video generation."""
    return """# Seedance Workflow Examples

## Workflow 1: Quick Video Generation
1. User: "Make me a video of waves on a beach"
2. Call `seedance_generate_video(prompt="Ocean waves gently crashing on sandy beach, sunset, cinematic")`
3. Return the task_id from the submission response
4. Poll with `seedance_get_task(task_id)` until the completed video URLs are available

## Workflow 2: Animate an Image
1. User provides image URL
2. Call `seedance_generate_video_from_image(prompt="Camera slowly zooming in, gentle movement", first_frame_url=user_url)`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Workflow 3: Create Transition Between Two Images
1. User provides two image URLs
2. Call `seedance_generate_video_from_image(first_frame_url=first_url, last_frame_url=second_url, prompt="Smooth morphing transition")`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Workflow 4: Style-Guided Generation
1. User provides reference images for style
2. Call `seedance_generate_video_from_image(prompt="...", reference_image_urls=[ref1, ref2])`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Workflow 5: High Quality with Audio
1. User wants premium video with sound
2. Call `seedance_generate_video(prompt="...", model="doubao-seedance-1-5-pro-251215", generate_audio=true, resolution="1080p")`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Workflow 6: Budget-Friendly Generation
1. User wants cheap/fast results
2. Call `seedance_generate_video(prompt="...", model="doubao-seedance-1-0-pro-fast-251015", service_tier="flex", resolution="480p")`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Workflow 7: Mobile-First Content
1. User wants content for TikTok/Instagram Reels
2. Call `seedance_generate_video(prompt="...", ratio="9:16")`
3. Return task_id and video URL

## Tips:
- Always be descriptive in prompts - include motion, style, mood
- Mention camera movements: "zooming in", "panning left", "tracking shot"
- Specify style: "cinematic", "realistic", "dreamy", "dramatic", "anime"
- For reproducible results, specify a seed value
- Use return_last_frame=true if planning to chain multiple video segments

@mcp.prompt()
def seedance_prompt_suggestions() -> str:
    """Tips for writing effective Seedance video prompts."""
    return """# Seedance Prompt Writing Guide

## Prompt Structure
A good Seedance prompt typically includes:
1. **Subject** - What is in the video
2. **Action** - What is happening (motion is key for video!)
3. **Setting** - Where it takes place
4. **Style** - Visual style and mood
5. **Camera** - Camera movement or angle

## Example Prompts

### Nature
- "A majestic eagle soaring over snow-capped mountains, golden hour lighting, cinematic aerial tracking shot"
- "Cherry blossoms falling in slow motion in a Japanese garden, soft focus, dreamy atmosphere"

### People
- "A dancer performing ballet on a stage, dramatic spotlight, slow motion spin, artistic"
- "A chef preparing sushi in a traditional kitchen, close-up hands, warm lighting"

### Abstract
- "Colorful paint droplets falling into water, macro shot, vibrant colors, slow motion"
- "Geometric patterns transforming and flowing, neon colors on dark background, hypnotic"

### Cinematic
- "Drone shot flying through a misty forest at dawn, rays of light filtering through trees"
- "Futuristic cityscape at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, cyberpunk aesthetic"

## Tips
- Be specific about motion and movement
- Include lighting descriptions
- Mention camera movements for dynamic videos
- Use style keywords: cinematic, realistic, anime, watercolor, etc.
- Keep prompts under 1000 characters
- For I2V, describe what should change/move from the reference image
